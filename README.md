# Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hello! I'm Osvaldo Holanda, and this is my GitHub repository, where I share my projects and learnings from the Web Fullstack course at Digital College. Here you will find a variety of web development projects, from front-end to back-end.

## About Me 🧑‍💻

I'm a technology enthusiast, excited to learn and improve my skills as a web developer. I'm currently focused on becoming a fullstack developer, with knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL databases.

## Contribution 🤝

I'm open to contributions and suggestions for improvements to the projects. Feel free to open an issue if you encounter any problems or to suggest new features.
